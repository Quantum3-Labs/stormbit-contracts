## Stormbit : on-chain lending structure 

#### Lenders
Lenders use the Stormbit protocol to deposit assets into lending terms, earning returns through interest and profit sharing. They can create and manage lending terms, delegate shares to specific terms, and withdraw from terms. Lenders also have the ability to claim profits once loans are repaid. They are incentivized to participate by earning a commission on the profits generated from loans.

#### Borrowers
Borrowers can request loans by specifying the token type and amount required. Once a loan request is made, it must be allocated by lenders before the borrower can execute and receive the funds. Borrowers are responsible for repaying the loan along with interest. If the loan is not executed by the deadline, it can be claimed back by the lender.

#### Terms
Terms define the conditions under which assets are lent and borrowed. They include parameters like commission rates and customizable hooks. Terms are created by lenders, who also manage the allocation of shares and profit distribution. Each term tracks the balance of shares and profits, ensuring transparent and fair distribution of returns to lenders.
